### Thus, the user will be able to view this change in position in an animated way. This is a new concept and it can be made better if we add this in a function, and with the help of setInterval() method, we can run this function every few seconds. That way, real-time updation will take place and the user won't have to refresh to fetch the latest data.
#### This idea can be implemented in the sites that show the latest trending blogs, story etc.
