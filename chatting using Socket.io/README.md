## Chatting using Socket.io
### We first create a personal chatroom if it doesn't already exist, then click on submit to view the respective chatroom and start chatting.
### It is integrated with MongoDB, therefore even after refreshing the page we are able to view the chats. Also, a function runs in the background every 3 seconds to check for any new notification.
